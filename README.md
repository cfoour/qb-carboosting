# FiveM Car Boosting Script
## Features
- Car Boosting Missions: Players can receive vehicle orders and complete missions by delivering stolen cars to a drop-off point.
- Mission Tiers: Vehicles are categorized into three tiers with increasing difficulty and rewards.
  - Tier 3: Lowest tier, simple missions.
  - Tier 2: Medium difficulty, requires tracker removal.
  - Tier 1: Highest difficulty, multiple minigames for tracker removal.
- Minigames: Engaging minigames (Scrambler, Thermite, Maze) for removing trackers from vehicles.
- Police Dispatch Integration: Alerts the police when a player is boosting a car. The police receive updates if the vehicle tracker is active.
- Cooldown System: Prevents players from starting new missions immediately after completing one. During cooldown, players are advised to lay low.
- Interactive Ped: Players interact with a ped to start, cancel, or complete missions.
- Notifications and Emails: Players receive notifications and emails via qb-phone for mission details and cooldown warnings.
- Configurable Options: Easily adjust mission parameters, rewards, and cooldown times via the config file.
